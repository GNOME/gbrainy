Here are the steps to create a new gbrainy release:

1) Send a message two weeks before the release to the gnome localization list asking translators to update gbrainy's translations

2) Run all the unit tests and verify that they pass

See tests/README

3) Update the file NEWS with the most rellevant changes

4) Make sure that the configure.ac contains the right version number for the release

5) Execute make 'make distcheck' and make sure that completes correctly

6) Do a smoke test to verify that gbrainy has been built properly

7) Tag the gbrainy git repository naming the tag label GBRAINY_X_Y_Z, where X and Y are the major versions and Z the revision number.

8) Upload the final tar.gz to a public location

9) Send a message to the gnome announce list

10) Update gbrainy releases page
