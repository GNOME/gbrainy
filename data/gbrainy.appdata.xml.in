    gbrainy is a game to train memory, arithmetical and logical capabilities 
    with many sorts of exercises of different difficulty levels. 
    </_p>
    <_p>
    It should have something for all ages and purposes: kids whose parents want 
    them to develop their capabilities, adults that want to keep their mind in 
    form or just try it out for fun, older people that might need to do some 
    memory exercises, etc.
