This is an experimental gbrainy web client using Mono's ASP.NET 3.5

== Background ==

* User preferences

To avoid deal with database access:

- We use the user session InProc session handler. The status.Aspx will not work with other session types.
- We store the user language using a cookie (named lang)

* Localization

Based on GNU GetText to reuse current translations

== Runing it ==

From command line:

* Call ./package.sh and generate and self-containing package to run gbrainy
* Unpackage it
* You can run it then using by just typing xps2

From Monodevelop:

* Call ./package.sh and generate and self-containing package. Unpackage it in the Webforms directory
* Run Monodevelop in Debug Mode
