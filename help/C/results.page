<p>When the game session is finished <app>gbrainy</app> shows a summary of the results of the session.</p>
<media type="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/results.png"></media>
<p>The results for every game type are computed using the <link xref="scoring">scoring</link> algorithm that takes into account time used, tips and the number of total games.</p>
<p><app>gbrainy</app> keeps track of the player's personal records using the player's game history. If you have obtained a better score that in previous games for any of the game types, <app>gbrainy</app> informs that a new personal record has been set. Otherwise, general tips on how to improve when playing next games are given.</p>
<p>If the number of games played during the session are minimum defined in the <link xref="preferences">Preferences</link> to store the session, then the results of the game session are recorded in the player's game history.</p>
