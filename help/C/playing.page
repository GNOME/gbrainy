	<p>The game session starts by showing a game and asking the user to solve it. Read always the instructions carefully. </p>

	<p>At the bottom of the application (see the capture below) you have the main set of controls to interact with the game.</p>

	<p>Once you know the answer you have to type it in the entry field next to the <gui>Answer:</gui> label.</p>

	<p>Some games include a tip that gives some guidance when trying to solve them. You can use the <gui>Tip</gui> button when it is enabled to get the tip.</p>
